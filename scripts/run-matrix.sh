#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/run-matrix.sh — wrapper around the fs-test-harness matrix
# runner that cleans up disk images on exit (success, failure, Ctrl-C,
# or any signal).
#
# Why a wrapper instead of fixing the harness directly:
# * The harness lives in `vendor/fs-test-harness/` (git submodule);
#   we don't own its lifecycle. Cleanup belongs in consumer code.
# * `init-image` (and ship-to-host) create .img files under HOST_IMAGE_DIR
#   and have no opinion about who removes them. Without this trap the
#   directory accumulates ~3-5 GiB of stale images across runs.
#
# Multi-instance safety:
# * The harness generates a unique run_id (ms timestamp) per invocation
#   so parallel run-matrix.sh instances write to separate subdirectories
#   under HOST_IMAGE_DIR and cannot trample each other's images.
# * A mkdir-based lock keyed on the scenario filter prevents two
#   instances from running the same scenario set simultaneously.
#   Stale locks (from killed processes) can be removed with:
#     rm -rf /tmp/ntfs-matrix-lock-*
#
# Usage: same as `vendor/fs-test-harness/scripts/run-tests.sh`. All
# arguments pass straight through. Examples:
#
#   bash scripts/run-matrix.sh                  # full matrix
#   bash scripts/run-matrix.sh basic-ro-list    # substring filter
#   bash scripts/run-matrix.sh --list           # don't run, just list
#   bash scripts/run-matrix.sh --keep-images    # skip the cleanup trap
#                                                 (handy for byte-diff
#                                                  inspection)
#
# Exit codes: pass-through from the harness runner. The trap fires
# regardless of exit code.
