#   scripts/core.sh ci-gate                    ci-ok needs every job; the guard names ci-ok alone

#   scripts/core.sh guest-rust-run NAME SHARE.. in a test VM: siblings, toolchain, then the suite
#
# THIS FILE IS THE SAME IN EVERY REPOSITORY, byte for byte, and its canonical
# copy is rust-fs-core's scripts/core.sh. It is the one piece a repository has
# to carry itself, because it is what finds rust-fs-core; everything it runs
# lives there and only there. The scripts it runs were once a separate copy in
# each repository, and the copies drifted: a fix made in one reached none of
# the others. Do not edit this copy -- change rust-fs-core's and copy it.
#
# WHERE CORE IS, in this order:
#   1. FS_CORE_ROOT, when set, and ONLY there: an override that falls through
#      to something else is not an override. A relative value is also tried
#      against this repository's root, decided by looking rather than by the
#      string's shape, which on Windows starts with a drive letter.
#   2. The sibling checkout ../rust-fs-core. Its path is built from this
#      file's own location, so it is POSIX on every runner, Git Bash
#      included, and a local change to core is exercised, not shadowed.
#   3. Wherever cargo resolved the am-fs-core dependency -- the registry copy
#      of the pinned release. Reading cargo's JSON needs python3.
#
# A COPY IS ACCEPTED ON ITS ANSWER TO --version AND NOTHING ELSE. A script
# that answers something else is fatal, not a reason to look elsewhere:
# "core is broken" reported as "core is missing" is the quieter failure.
#
# The script runs with FS_CORE_CALLER set to this repository's root, which is
# where it reads logs, manifests and workflows from.
